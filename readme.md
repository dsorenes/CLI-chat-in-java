Has basic chat functionality

As of 26.03.2019 01:56 it is just a simple echo server

Goal:
Make a multi-user chat application in java.

TODO (in this order):
1. Make the server handle several clients *DONE*
2. Have the clients speak to the server synchronously
3. Make the server respond to each individual client synchronously


What I'll learn:
sockets

server and client side programming

threads

streams

communication between server and client

multi-threading and handling
