Has basic chat functionality

As of 26.03.2019 01:56 it is just a simple echo server
As of 28.03.2019 04:09 it handles multiple clients. It also keeps track of currently connected and disconnected sockets.
As of 28.03.2019 04:56 the clients can now communicate with eachother over the server, but it's wonky as hell. This needs to be fixed. Currently no idea how..


Goal:
Make a multi-user chat application in java.

TODO (in this order):
1. Make the server handle several clients *DONE*
2. Make server handle connections and disconnections properly *DONE*
3. Have the clients speak to the server synchronously *DONE*
4. Make the server respond to each individual client synchronously *DONE BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT*
5. Fix the issues with communication


What I'll learn:
sockets

server and client side programming

threads

streams

communication between server and client

multi-threading and handling
